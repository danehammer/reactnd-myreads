# Libros MÃ­os

Udacity React Nanodegree Project 1

Uses `https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com` to render a list of categories of books, allowing the user
to move them between categories and add more.

## TODOs

[ ] save the books as state so we can use the response from PUT /books/:id
[ ] add some shadows to be cool
